# unit-4-game

In this project I have created an interactive game for your browser. This time the app will dynamically update the HTML with the jQuery libary.

# Getting started 

The user is given a random number at the start of the game. There are four crystals on the page. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score. You win the game by matching your total score to the random number. You lose the game if your total score goes above the random number. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.
